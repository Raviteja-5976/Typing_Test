he quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.
How razorback-jumping frogs can level six piqued gymnasts!
The five boxing wizards jump quickly.
Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.
Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.
The quick onyx goblin jumps over the lazy dwarf.
Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz.
Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed.
